# TRIAGE.AI Elite (Clinical Hospital OS) 🏥

**The state-of-the-art AI-powered clinical lifecycle management system for modern emergency care.**

### 🚀 [Live Demo](https://triage-ai-tawny.vercel.app/)

TRIAGE.AI is not just a triage tool; it's a complete **Clinical Hospital Operating System** designed to eliminate bottlenecks in emergency departments. By integrating an advanced **Clinical Tiered-Scoring Engine (CTSE)**, it ensures every patient is prioritized with pinpoint accuracy based on symptom intensity and medical risk.

## 🔥 Enterprise-Grade Features

### 🧠 Clinical Tiered-Scoring Engine (CTSE) v5.2
Our proprietary AI logic doesn't just look for keywords; it analyzes **Intensity Modifiers**. 
- **Tier 1 (Emergency)**: Automatic detection of life-threatening events (e.g., cardiac arrest, seizure, stroke).
- **Tier 2 (Urgent)**: Identification of acute conditions (e.g., fractures, severe pain, dehydration).
- **Tier 3 (Normal)**: Management of minor ailments (e.g., common cold, mild headache).
- **Intensity Boosters**: Words like *"excruciating"*, *"intense"*, or *"sudden"* act as multipliers, escalating triage levels instantly to prevent medical oversights.

### 🏥 Smart Clinical Routing
Automated routing to **10+ Specialized Departments**:
| Department | Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cardiology** | Heart, Chest Pain, EKG anomalies |
| **Neurology** | Stroke, Seizures, Concussions, Neural pain |
| **Orthopedics** | Fractures, Joint injuries, Bone issues |
| **Pulmonology** | Respiratory distress, Asthma, Pneumonia |
| **Gastroenterology** | Abdominal intensity, Gastric distress |
| **Pediatrics** | Specialized care for infants and children |
| **Dermatology** | Acute skin conditions, burns, rashes |
| **Ophthalmology** | Vision loss, acute eye trauma |

### ✨ Elite Design System
- **Adaptive Glassmorphism**: A stunning, high-performance UI that feels alive and responsive.
- **Precision Dark Mode**: Class-based theme engine with high-contrast surfaces optimized for low-light clinical environments.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Live Dashboard powered by automated queue reordering based on clinical priority.

### 🎙️ AI Voice Integration
Integrated **Smart Intake Voice Protocol** allowing for rapid, hands-free patient symptom reporting, significantly reducing intake time by up to 40%.

## ⚙️ Rapid Deployment Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (LTS version)
- **MongoDB Atlas** connection string

### 2. Implementation
1. **Clone the Intelligence**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kanishkhan/triage-ai.git
   cd triage-ai
   ```
2. **Configure the Nerve Center**:
   Create `/backend/.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_cluster_uri
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
3. **Ignite the System**:
   ```bash
   # From root
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📖 Operational Protocol

1. **Intake**: Patient enters symptoms (Text or Voice).
2. **Analysis**: AI Engine scores symptoms + intensity.
3. **Priority**: Queue reorders instantly. **Emergency** cases are forced to the top.
4. **Resolution**: Staff marks triage as completed, moving patients through the facility lifecycle.
